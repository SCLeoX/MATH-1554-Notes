## 1. Consider the sequence of row operations that reduce matrix $A$ to the identity.
$$
A = \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
  0 & 4 & 0 \\
  1 & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & 8 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}}_{A}
\sim
\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & 4 & 0 \\
  0 & 8 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}}_{E_1 A}
\sim
\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & 4 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}}_{E_2 E_1 A}
\sim
\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & 1 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}}_{E_3 E_2 E_1 A}
$$

Construct the elementary matrices $E_1$, $E_2$, $E_3$.

**Solution:** Observe that $E_1$ represents a row swap between the first row and the second row, so we write:

$$
E_1 = \begin{bmatrix}
  0 & 1 & 0 \\
  1 & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Similarly, $E_2$ represents adding $-2 \times R2$ to the third row, so we write:

$$
E_1 = \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & 1 & 0 \\
  0 & -2 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

$E_3$, however, represents a scalar multiply of $\frac{1}{4}$ applied to the second row, so we write:

$$
E_1 = \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & \frac{1}{4} & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

## 2. Indicate whether the statements are true of false, given $A$ is a $m \times n$ matrix.
### a. If $A\vec{x}=A\vec{y}$ for some $\vec{x} \neq \vec{y} \in \mathbb{R}^n$, then $A$ cannot be invertible.
**Solution:** True. If a matrix can transform two different vectors to a same vector, this transformation is not one-to-one. Since $A$ is a square matrix, the standard matrix $A$ is not invertible.

### b. If If for every $\vec{b} \in \mathbb{R}^n$, $A\vec{x} = \vec{b}$ has at least one solution, then $A$ is invertible.
**Solution:** True. If this matrix always have solution, it is onto. Since $A$ is a square matrix, the standard matrix $A$ is invertible.

### c. Every elementary matrix is invertible.
**Solution:** True.

## 3. Compute the inverse of the matrix, where $c \in \mathbb{R}$. For what values of $c$ does the matrix have an inverse?
$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}
  0 & 1 & 1 \\
  2 & 0 & 4 \\
  0 & -1 & c \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

**Solution:**

> Inverse is $\begin{bmatrix} -\frac{2}{c+1} & \frac{1}{2} & -\frac{2}{c+1} \\ 1 - \frac{2}{c+1} & 0 & -\frac{2}{c+1} \\ \frac{2}{c+1} & 0 & \frac{2}{c+1} \end{bmatrix}$. -- TA

If we only want to determine what values of $c$ does the matrix have an inverse, we only need to row reduce $A$, which yields $\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 2 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & c + 1 \end{bmatrix}$. Since we want it to be invertible, we need a pivot on every row. That is, we just need to make sure $c + 1 \neq 0$, which leads to $c \neq -1$.

## 4. Let $A$ be an $n \times n$ matrix. Which statements guarantee that $A$ is invertible?
### a. Every vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is in the span of the columns of $A$.
**Solution:** Yes, because it is equivalent of saying the transformation is onto.

### b. $A\vec{x} = \vec{b}$ has a solution for every $\vec{b} \in \mathbb{R}^n$.
**Solution:** Yes, because it is also equivalent of saying the transformation is onto.

### c. Matrix $A$ can be row reduced to the identity matrix.
**Solution:** Yes, because the row operations executed applied to the identity matrix gives you inverse.

### d. The range of the linear transformation $\vec{x} \rightarrow A\vec{x}$ is $\mathbb{R}^n$.
**Solution:** Yes, because it is also$^2$equivalent of saying the transformation is onto.

## 5. Question is stupid
Takeaway: A matrix is not invertibe if

- One column is a multiple of the another column
- One column is the sum of other columns
