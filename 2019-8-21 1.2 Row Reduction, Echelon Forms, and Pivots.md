# 2019-8-21 1.2 Row Reduction, Echelon Forms, and Pivots
## Reviewish
Generally, more equations than unknows leads to no solution.

However, in the following case, there are $\infty$ number of solutions, because they describe the same line.

$$
\begin{alignedat}{4}
   x & {}+{} &  y & = 1 \\
  2x & {}+{} & 2y & = 2 \\
  3x & {}+{} & 3y & = 3 \\
\end{alignedat}
$$

Variables can also be hidden:

$$
\begin{alignedat}{4}
  x & {}+{} & y &       &   & = 1 \\
    &       &   & {}+{} & z & = 0 \\
\end{alignedat}
$$

## Row Reduction and Echelon Forms
### Echelon Form: Rectangular matrix is in the Echelon form if:
1. All zero rows (if any) are at the bottom.
2. The first non-zero entry (leading entry) for a row is to the right of any leading entry above.
3. All elements below a leading entry must be 0.

$$
\left[
\begin{array}{cccccc}
0 & A & * & * & * & * \\
0 & 0 & A & * & * & * \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & A & * \\
\end{array}
\right]
$$

- `*` -> any
- `A` -> nonzero

### Row Reduced Echelon Form (RREF)
1. All leading entries (if any) are 1.
2. Leading entries are the only nonzero entry in their respective column.

#### Examples:

---

$$
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
  1 & 0 \\
  0 & 2 \\
\end{array}
\right]
$$

**NO**, because of `2`.

---

$$
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc}
  1 & 17 & 0 \\
  0 &  0 & 1 \\
\end{array}\right]
$$

**YES**

---

$$
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
  0 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 \\
\end{array}
\right]
$$

**YES**

---

$$
\left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
  0 & 6 & 3 & 0 \\
\end{array}
\right]
$$

**NO**, because of `6`.

---

$$
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
  0 \\
  1 \\
  0 \\
  0 \\
\end{array}
\right]
$$

**NO**, because of `1` has `0` above it.

## Pivot Position
A **pivot** in matrix $A$ is a location in $A$ that is a leading 1 in the RREF of $A$.

A **pivot column** is a column of $A$ that contains a pivot position.

### Example
Reduce the following matrix to RREF and find pivot columns:

$$
\left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
   0 & -3 & -6 & 4 \\
  -1 & -2 & -1 & 3 \\
  -2 & -3 &  0 & 3 \\
\end{array}
\right]
$$

**Answer:**

$$
\left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
  1 & 0 & -3 & 0 \\
  0 & 1 &  2 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 &  0 & 1 \\
\end{array}
\right]
$$

## Free
$$
\left[
\begin{array}{c|c}
  A & \vec{b} \\
\end{array}
\right] = \left[
\begin{array}{ccccc|c}
  1 & 3 & 0 & 7 & 0 & 4 \\
  0 & 0 & 1 & 4 & 0 & 5 \\
  0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 6 \\
\end{array}
\right]
$$

Represents

$$
A \vec{x} = \vec{b}
$$

Pivot columns: first, third, and fifth column.

Free columns: second, fourth, and sixth column.

Any choice of free variable will lead to a solution.

Transform the above matrix to a linear system:

$$
\begin{alignedat}{6}
  x_1 & {}+{} & 3x_2 &       &     & {}+{} & 7x_4 &       &     & = 4 \\
      &       &      & {}+{} & x_3 & {}+{} & 4x_4 &       &     & = 5 \\
      &       &      &       &     &       &      & {}+{} & x_5 & = 6 \\
\end{alignedat}
$$

### Theorem
A linear system is consistent if and only if the last column of the augmented matrix does not have a pivot.

(RREF does not have a row of the following form)

$$
\left[
\begin{array}{ccccc|c}
  0 & 0 & 0 & ... & 0 & 1 \\
\end{array}
\right]
$$

If consistent, and...
- there is no free variable, there will be only one unique solution.
- there are free variables, there will be infinitely many solutions.
